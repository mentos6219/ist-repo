		<h1>World Wide Web (WWW)</h1>
		<p>The World Wide Web defined simply, is a global collection of documents and other resources identified by links. In other words, it is a collection of webpages found on the internet. Hyperlinks, or simply links, are references to other webpages or websites by clicking on it. Links come in two forms, hypertext links and hypermedia links. Hypertext is text that contains links to other text documents whereas hypermedia is an extension of hypertext and can link to other forms of media such as images, movies, audio as well as text.</p>
		<a href="https://mentos6219.github.io/ist-repo/ass1.html">This is a hyperlink</a>
		<p>Web servers are essentially powerful computers that store all of the website's files being the website's HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets and javascript files. It is possible to host your own website's files on your personal computer but it is preferred to host your website's files on a dedicated web servers because they are always active, connected to the internet and always retain the same IP address.</p>
		<p>Web browsers are applications used to access the World Wide Web. Web browsers are applications that connects to a website's server and displays the website's webpages. Web browsers work by retrieving information from the web server that the user requests and displays the content of the webpage on the user's device. Popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Safari and Microsoft Edge</p>

		<h1>The Internet</h1>
		<p>The internet is a global interconnected system of computers and other devices that communicate to each other through internet protocols. The internet is often confused with the World Wide Web although they are different. The World Wide Web is a collection of documents whereas the Internet is the global interconnected system of computers and devices. To access the World Wide Web, users must use the internet. Another notable difference is that the World Wide Web is interconnected through hyperlinks and URLs whereas the internet helps users access those hyperlinks and URLs on websites</p>
		<p>The internet can be explained with an analogy. Imagine that the internet is a city. You want to navigate it and visit to your friend's house which is the desired website to want to visit. Imagine that the suburb that your friend lives in is the web server and the roads that lead to your friend's house are URLs and hyperlinks.</p>
